Tropical Cyclone Hazard Model – One-Page Description

Purpose
This model estimates how often tropical storm– and hurricane-force winds affect specific Caribbean islands and 
produces stochastic (simulated) annual event sequences that can be directly coupled to a system-dynamics (SD) 
model of port, infrastructure, and supply-chain disruption. The model focuses on what each island actually 
experiences, not just how strong a storm is at its center.

Core Inputs

1) Historical storm data (IBTrACS, North Atlantic)
For each tropical cyclone at 6-hour intervals:
- Storm ID, year, and timestamp
- Storm center latitude and longitude
- Maximum sustained wind at the storm center (knots)
- Directional wind radii for 34, 50, and 64-knot winds (by NE/SE/SW/NW quadrant)
- Storm forward speed

2) Target locations (islands/sites)
- Name, latitude, longitude for each island (e.g., Saba, Statia)

3) Model configuration
- Wind thresholds (34, 50, 64 kt)
- Computational distance gate (e.g., 800 km)
- Minimum analysis year (e.g., 1970)
- Optional island-specific disruption thresholds (e.g., port or infrastructure shutdown winds)
- Simulation length (e.g., 1000 synthetic years)

Analytical Steps

Step 1 – Data cleaning and preparation
Storm tracks are cleaned and standardized. Wind radii and wind speeds are converted to numeric values, 
implausible values are removed, and timestamps are parsed.

Step 2 – Select storms that could affect each island
For each island, storm track points farther than a large distance gate are discarded. This gate is purely 
computational and does not define impact.

Step 3 – Determine storm–island geometry
For each retained track point:
- Distance from storm center to island is computed.
- Bearing from storm center to island is calculated.
- Island is assigned to a storm quadrant (NE, SE, SW, NW).

This allows selection of the correct directional wind radii, capturing storm asymmetry.

Step 4 – Construct the wind field at the island
Using storm center wind speed, distance to the island, and directional radii:
- A physically consistent radial wind-decay profile is built (Holland-type formulation).
- The radius of maximum winds (RMW) is estimated consistently.
- A forward-motion asymmetry term adjusts winds depending on storm motion.

Result: an estimated sustained wind speed at the island for every 6-hour storm position.

Step 5 – Aggregate to storm-level events
All 6-hour wind estimates for a given storm and island are aggregated into a single event:
- Peak wind speed experienced at the island
- Duration above 34, 50, and 64 kt
- Whether tropical storm or hurricane conditions occurred
- Optional flags for port or infrastructure disruption

Each storm contributes one row per island.

Step 6 – Define severity based on island impact
Storms are classified by the maximum wind actually experienced at the island:
- None (<34 kt)
- Tropical Storm (34–63 kt)
- Hurricane (≥64 kt)

Step 7 – Compute annual event frequencies
For each island, distinct storm events are counted per year by severity. Years with no events are included as zeros.

Step 8 – Fit stochastic occurrence models
Mean annual occurrence rates are estimated for each severity class. An optional over-dispersion factor captures active 
versus quiet hurricane seasons.

Step 9 – Monte Carlo simulation
Using the fitted rates, the model simulates hundreds to thousands of synthetic years of storm occurrence for each island.

Outputs

Primary outputs:
- Annual probability and frequency of tropical storm and hurricane impacts per island
- Synthetic annual event sequences
- Event-level indicators such as peak wind, exposure duration, and disruption flags

Secondary outputs:
- Time series of estimated island wind speeds
- Storm-by-storm summaries of intensity and exposure

Key Strengths
- Impact-based: severity defined by local wind exposure
- Physically grounded: directional radii, radial decay, and motion asymmetry
- SD-ready: outputs are discrete events and annual rates
- Scalable: suitable for small islands with limited historical samples
