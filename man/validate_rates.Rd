\title{Compare model-fitted rates against reference climatologies}
\usage{
validate_rates(out, ref_rates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{out}{List returned by \code{run_hazard_model()}.}

\item{ref_rates}{Optional tibble of reference rates (default: \code{get_reference_rates()}).}
}
\value{
Tibble with model vs reference rate comparison.
}
\description{
Takes the lambda table from the hazard model output and compares per-location
per-storm_class rates against published references. Reports absolute and
percentage differences, and flags rates outside expected bounds.

A key consideration: the model uses an 800 km gate and computes site wind at the
target, so its effective "passage radius" is set by the wind field, not the gate.
The reference rates use a fixed radius (65-100 nm). We flag discrepancies > 2x as
potentially indicating a gate/radius mismatch rather than a model error.
