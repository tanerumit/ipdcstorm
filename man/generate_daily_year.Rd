\title{Generate a daily wind time series for a single calendar year}
\usage{
generate_daily_year(
  year,
  sampled_events,
  thr_port = NA_real_,
  thr_infra = NA_real_,
  pulse_shape = "cosine"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Integer calendar year.}

\item{sampled_events}{Tibble from \code{sample_events_for_year()}.}

\item{thr_port}{Optional numeric wind threshold (kt) for port disruption.}

\item{thr_infra}{Optional numeric wind threshold (kt) for infrastructure disruption.}

\item{pulse_shape}{Pulse shape passed to \code{event_pulse()}.}
}
\value{
Tibble with date, wind_kt, and optional disruption flags.
}
\description{
Converts sampled storm events into a daily time series of maximum sustained
wind at a site. Overlapping events are combined by daily maximum wind.
