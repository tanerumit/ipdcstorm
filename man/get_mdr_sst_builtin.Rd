\title{Built-in MDR SST annual means from NOAA ERSST v5}
\usage{
get_mdr_sst_builtin()
}
\value{
Tibble with columns: year (integer), sst_mdr_aso (numeric, A?C).
}
\description{
Returns a tibble of annual-mean SST (A?C) averaged over the Main Development
Region (MDR: 10a?"20A?N, 80a?"20A?W) for the Atlantic hurricane season (Auga?"Oct,
the peak months most predictive of activity).

Values are derived from NOAA ERSST v5 monthly data, spatially averaged over
the MDR box, then temporally averaged over ASO (Aug-Sep-Oct) each year.

These are provided as a built-in fallback so the model can run without
requiring users to download and process NetCDF files.
