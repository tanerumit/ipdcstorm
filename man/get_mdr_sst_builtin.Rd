\title{Built-in MDR SST annual means from NOAA ERSST v5}
\usage{
get_mdr_sst_builtin()
}
\value{
Tibble with columns: year (integer), sst_mdr_aso (numeric, Â°C).
}
\description{
Returns a tibble of annual-mean SST (Â°C) averaged over the Main Development
Region (MDR: 10â€“20Â°N, 80â€“20Â°W) for the Atlantic hurricane season (Augâ€“Oct,
the peak months most predictive of activity).

Values are derived from NOAA ERSST v5 monthly data, spatially averaged over
the MDR box, then temporally averaged over ASO (Aug-Sep-Oct) each year.

These are provided as a built-in fallback so the model can run without
requiring users to download and process NetCDF files.
