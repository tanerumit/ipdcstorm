\title{Add hazard intensity and damage forcing from daily wind}
\usage{
add_damage_forcing(daily, V0 = 34, V1 = 120, p = 3, dmax = 0.02)
}
\arguments{
\item{daily}{Tibble/data.frame with at least \code{wind_kt}.}

\item{V0}{Numeric; threshold wind (kt) below which intensity is zero.}

\item{V1}{Numeric; wind (kt) at which intensity saturates at 1.}

\item{p}{Numeric; nonlinearity exponent.}

\item{dmax}{Numeric; maximum daily damage fraction.}
}
\value{
Tibble with added columns:
damage_intensity, damage_rate.
}
\description{
Maps daily wind speed to a bounded hazard intensity (0..1) and a bounded daily
damage rate (0..dmax).
}
