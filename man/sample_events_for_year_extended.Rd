\title{Sample synthetic storm events for a year with extended attributes}
\usage{
sample_events_for_year_extended(lib, year, n_ts, n_hur, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{lib}{Event library produced by \code{build_event_library()}.}

\item{year}{Integer calendar year.}

\item{n_ts}{Integer number of tropical storms to sample.}

\item{n_hur}{Integer number of hurricanes to sample.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer seed.}
}
\value{
Tibble with columns: severity, start_date, dur_days, V_peak,
event_id, event_class, Pc_min_hPa, dP_max_hPa, RMW_mean_km.
}
\description{
Extended version of \code{sample_events_for_year()} that also carries
atmospheric attributes (Pc, dP, RMW) and event metadata needed by
\code{generate_daily_year_extended()}.

For each sampled event, extracts from the event library row:
\itemize{
\item \code{event_id}: unique identifier (SID or generated).
\item \code{event_class}: "TC" or "HUR" (for the daily dominant-event tracker).
\item \code{Pc_min_hPa}: minimum central pressure.
\item \code{dP_max_hPa}: maximum pressure deficit.
\item \code{RMW_mean_km}: mean radius of maximum wind.
}
}
