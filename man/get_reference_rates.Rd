\title{Reference HURDAT2/literature annual rates for Leeward Islands region}
\usage{
get_reference_rates()
}
\value{
Tibble with columns: region, storm_class, lambda_ref, source, gate_approx_nm, period.
}
\description{
Returns a tibble of published annual TC passage rates from literature,
for comparison against model-fitted lambdas. Sources:
\itemize{
\item Tropical storm (34+ kt) passage rates within ~100 nm of Leeward Islands
from Neumann et al. (1999), Landsea et al. (various HURDAT2 analyses),
and NHC climatology tables.
\item Hurricane (64+ kt) passage rates from the same sources.
\item Values represent storms passing within roughly 100-150 nm radius
(comparable to the model's effective gate after wind field application).
