\arguments{
\item{events_island}{Tibble of storm events for one location (from \code{out$events}).
Must contain: year, storm_class, storm_id, peak_wind_kt.}

\item{location}{Character; location name (for labelling).}

\item{holdout_years}{Integer; number of years to hold out from the end.}

\item{n_sim}{Integer; number of synthetic years to simulate from training parameters.}

\item{return_periods}{Numeric vector of return periods to compare.}

\item{severities}{Character vector of storm classes (passed to compute_annual_counts).}

\item{seed}{Integer seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{location}{location name.}
\item{train_years}{Integer vector of training years.}
\item{test_years}{Integer vector of test years.}
\item{train_params}{List: lambda_table, k_hat, n_train_years.}
\item{obs_annual_max}{Tibble of observed annual max V_site by year (full record).}
\item{obs_test_rl}{Named vector of observed return levels from test period.}
\item{sim_rl}{Named vector of simulated return levels.}
\item{sim_rl_ci}{Tibble of simulated return level confidence intervals (bootstrap).}
\item{comparison}{Tibble comparing observed vs simulated at each return period.}
}
\description{
Splits historical events into training and test periods, refits the frequency
model on training data, simulates synthetic annual maxima, and compares
simulated return-level quantiles against observed test-period annual maxima.
