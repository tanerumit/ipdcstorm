}
\arguments{
\item{val}{Output from \code{run_validation_suite()}.}

\item{out_dir}{Directory to save plots in.}

\item{base_size}{Base font size for plots.}
}
\value{
Path of saved plot (invisibly) or \code{NULL}.

\description{
Creates per-location QQ plots of simulated annual maximum wind speeds against
observed values. The simulated quantiles are computed from the 5000-year
synthetic record, while observed quantiles come from the full historical record.

Departures from the 1:1 line reveal where the model systematically over- or
under-predicts: curvature upward at the right tail indicates overprediction of
extreme events (a common sign of intensity distribution or GEV tail issues).
