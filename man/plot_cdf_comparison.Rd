\title{Plot CDF comparison of simulated vs observed annual maxima}
\usage{
plot_cdf_comparison(val, out_dir = "output/validation", base_size = 11)
}
\arguments{
\item{val}{Output from \code{run_validation_suite()}.}

\item{out_dir}{Directory to save plots in.}

\item{base_size}{Base font size for plots.}
}
\value{
Path of saved plot (invisibly) or \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
Overlays the empirical CDFs of simulated and observed annual maximum wind speeds
for each location. A systematic leftward shift of the simulated CDF (higher winds
at the same exceedance probability) indicates overprediction.

Also shows the fitted hurdle-GEV CDF for the simulated data, allowing visual
assessment of whether the parametric fit captures the simulated distribution.
