\title{Plot bias decomposition: frequency vs intensity contributions}
\usage{
plot_bias_diagnostics(val, out_dir = "output/validation", base_size = 11)
}
\arguments{
\item{val}{Output from \code{run_validation_suite()}.}

\item{out_dir}{Directory to save plots in.}

\item{base_size}{Base font size for plots.}
}
\value{
Named character vector of saved plot paths (invisibly) or \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
Decomposes the overprediction (or underprediction) of return levels into
two sources:
(a) Frequency bias: the model simulates too many / too few events per year.
(b) Intensity bias: simulated event intensities are too high / too low.

For each location, compares:
\itemize{
\item Observed vs simulated mean annual event rate (frequency)
\item Observed vs simulated mean event intensity (conditional on occurrence)
\item Observed vs simulated fraction of zero-event years
}
}
